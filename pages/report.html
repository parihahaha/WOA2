      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Women of Australia is a web development project as a part of the Bachelor of Computer Science at University of London. Women of Australia tells stories of women from all over Australia in different disciplines. I have chosen the path of a newsletter for this subject to create a place that informs women about how other women are succeeding in this country and celebrate their moment together. <br><br>

        Users are targeted to women from all over Australia who are interested in women in leadership and personal development.

      <h5 class="card-header blue">3 things that have inspired me when creating this website</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
           1. During the women in leadership week several events inspired me to develop a platform that allows women in Australia to connect with each other all year round. I am personally interested in women in leadership and would like to continue to support women from my community who are doing great things. <br><br>
            2. During my career, I have been supported by an amazing group of women. I was lucky to receive mentorship from amazing women and would love to expand that opportunity to other people who need it. I would like my project to contribute to a cause. I want the project I am working on to have the potential of being a real project. That’s why I am creating this initiative alongside a web development program. I want my project to have a social impact.<br><br>
            3. An Instagram account called @david.webdev and @hackuniversity about website development was used as a source of User interface and coding inspiration. I also searched for inspiration from Behance and Medium.

        <p class="card-text">
            1. This website is responsive. Users can access this website from their desktop computer, tablet, and mobile phone. The design was made from the start to incorporate accessibility of different devices. <br><br>
            2.Font sizes are carefully chosen to make sure that it is big enough for readers with visual impairment. Fonts are at least 16 px. Text background was also chosen to have high contrast to assist people with colorblindness.<br><br>
            3.Alt text was added to ensure the experience of people with visual issues who use text to

      <h5 class="card-header blue">State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.  </h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
            1. Navigation: All navigation aspects are made for familiarity of the website. I have the navigation bar at the top for the desktop version and hamburger menu for the mobile version. While I understand that the hamburger menu for mobile websites is not universal, it is still considered as industry standard for web development. <br><br>
            2. User goals: Design with the users’ goals in mind. Navigation and content were made to target users who are looking for industry connections with other female professionals. <br><br>
            3.Responsive design: Design for different devices to allow users to access this website from a variety of devices they have.

      <h5 class="card-header yellow">State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).  </h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
            1. Bootstrap Documentation: I use Bootstrap as a framework for my website to provide a responsive website to users. I had to learn the grid system, column, and other position aspects of Bootstrap to create masonry content for the news page which provides a page that is responsive on all devices. <br><br>
            2. Google Developer Documentation: I found an interesting discussion on the Google Developers Documentation which discusses different ways of implementing Google products on the website such as Google search, Google map, and translation. While I was not able to implement their product for my project, I am interested in learning more about this to further develop my skills in website development. <br><br>
            3. While designing mockups for the website, I thought a masonry news page was not possible. After learning more about Bootstrap and its implementation method, I was able to implement a masonry news page which I am very proud of.

      <h5 class="card-header blue">What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
           Designing the project with the website development process in mind helps me write code more efficiently. I designed the part that would fit the goals of the website then did some research on what would be the best template to use. Having a design in place helps the website development run more smoothly.

      <h5 class="card-header yellow">What aspect(s) of your work could be improved?</h5>

        <p class="card-text">
          I would like to do more research into Javascript and its applications on website aniation. With my limited knowledge in Javascript, I chose not to implement something beyond my comfort zone . Being able to add animation effects would be a great addition to any website. I also have not implemented the search bar where I would like to learn to use Google powered searches, but I did not have enough time during this assignment.
