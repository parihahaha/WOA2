        <p><br>Our mission is to connect women from all industry in Australia to empower each other to follow their dream. 
            As women, we have power. We have potential. We have whatever it takes to make our dream come true.
            Women in Australia acknowledge the importance of celebrating women achievement. We are here for each other through hot and cold.
            This project is inspired by International Women in Leadership week. I felt deeply inspired that week to learn from other women in the industry
            so I thought why don't we have this on a regular basis? We can get inspired by each other every week.
